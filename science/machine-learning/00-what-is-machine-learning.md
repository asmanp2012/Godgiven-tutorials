# 00 - What is Machine learning?

Machine Learning is a computer program that said to learn from `experience` `E` with respect to some class of `tasks` `T` and `performance measure` `P`, if its performance at tasks in `T`, as measured by `P`, improves with experience `E`.

ML is a field of AI consisting of learning algorithms that

- Improve their performance (`P`)
- At executing some task (`T`)
- Over time with experience (`E`)

You can use any of programing lang for machine learning like:

- `Matlab`: MATLAB is a proprietary multi-paradigm programming language and numeric computing environment developed by MathWorks.
- `Python`: Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
- `C++`: C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation
- `Javascript`: V8 is Google's open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++.

----

- Several AI people may not have a very solid programming or computer science background. then AI lib's don't grow more in c++ and it's harder for this field.
- Matlab is not free but have good tools and power in AI.
- Javascript at the start make for web and don't have a lot of experience in this field
- Python is the preferred choice of programming for other people that not have computer knowledge because the learning curve for Python is comparatively less steep. For this reason, Python has more growth in other knowledge.

For learn machine learning I chose python because:

- python is free vs matlab
- python have a lot of package for machine learning
- machine learning community have more attention to python

We have three methods of machine Learning based on human supervision:

- `Supervised`: This method or learning algorithm take the training data
- `Unsupervised`: Unsupervised learning algorithms do not have the liberty of having pre-labeled training data.
- `Semi-supervised`: This method or learning algorithm neither fully supervised nor fully unsupervised. this basically fall between the two i.e.
